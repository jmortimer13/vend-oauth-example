# Vend OAuth Example
This is a NodeJS app which uses ExpressJS to perform the OAuth login flow to Vend

# Setup
## Requirements
### vend accounts
You need to create a vend merchant store AND a vend developer account!\
- https://www.vendhq.com/ (Select Free Trial)
- https://developers.vendhq.com/developer/sign-in 

You must also make an app to get a clientId and clientSecret.\
You can fill in a fake URL for the redirect URI, but will need to replace it later in the guide.

### node
This app is built with Node 16.x, you can use NVM to install node versions:\
`nvm install 16.4.2`

Once you have Node, do the typical install:\
`npm install`

### ngrok
Ngrok is a tool that allows secure HTTPS tunneling which is important for the OAuth process to work:\
`brew install --cask ngrok`

## Running the app
### Step 1: Run ngrok on port 3000
`ngrok http 3000`

COPY the https ngrok URL into your Vend application "redirect URI" field!\
You will also need to COPY this URL into the index.js file as described in the next step.

### Step 2: Update index.js
Look at the `index.js` file and fill in all the REPLACEME instances with your own data
- clientId (provided by Vend)
- clientSecret (provided by Vend)
- redirectURI (ngrok url)

### Step 3: Run the app
`node index.js`

You will see a message that the app is running on port 3000

### Step 4: Perform OAuth sign in
- Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
- Click `Sign In` and sign in to your mrechant
- Click `Get Refresh Token` to get a refresh token and your initial access token
- Click `Get Access Token` to refresh your access token

You will need to repeat step 4 every time you open the app.\
You need to replace the redirect URI in Vend AND index.js each time you start ngrok as the URL will change.
